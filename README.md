Why Use a Hash Tree for Large Signatures
Handling large signatures, such as those over 49,000 bytes, can be challenging due to their size and complexity. Hereâ€™s why a hash tree (also known as a Merkle tree) is useful for managing such large data:

1. Efficient Verification:
A hash tree allows you to efficiently verify the integrity of large data sets. Instead of checking the entire signature, you can verify smaller chunks, which reduces computational overhead.

2. Reduced Size for Comparison:
By breaking the data into smaller pieces and hashing them, you can reduce the size of the data that needs to be compared. The root hash of the tree represents the entire dataset, so you only need to handle the root hash for comparison.

3.  Parallel Processing:
You can process different parts of the data in parallel, which speeds up hashing and verification. The structure of the hash tree naturally supports parallel computation, as each level of the tree can be processed independently.

4. Error Detection:
The hash tree structure helps in detecting any changes or corruption in the data. Even a small modification in the original data will result in a completely different root hash, making it easy to spot discrepancies.

How It Works
1. Leaf Nodes:
Each leaf node in the hash tree represents a small chunk of the signature. You compute the hash of each chunk and create leaf nodes with these hashes.

2. Building the Tree:
The tree is built in levels. At each level, pairs of nodes are combined (concatenated) and hashed to create a new parent node. This process continues until you reach the root node.

3. Root Hash:
The root node of the hash tree contains the hash of the entire dataset. This single hash value summarizes the integrity of all the leaf nodes below it.
Storing and Accessing Data:
In your implementation, leaf nodes can be stored in a LevelDB database. This allows you to efficiently manage and retrieve large datasets by storing each leaf separately.

4. Memory Mapping:
For large files, memory mapping (using syscall.Mmap) is used to handle file access efficiently. This method allows you to work with large files without loading them entirely into memory.

Example Walkthrough
1. Generate Data:
Random data is generated and split into chunks (leaf nodes).

2. Compute Hashes:
Compute the SHA-256 hash for each chunk.

3. Build the Tree:
Combine hashes in pairs, compute new hashes for each combined pair, and repeat until a single root hash is obtained.

4. Store Data:
Save the leaf nodes to LevelDB and the root hash to a file.

5. Verify Data:
To verify, you can recompute the root hash from the leaf nodes and compare it to the stored root hash.

Using a hash tree helps manage and verify large signatures efficiently, making it an effective solution for handling and processing large amounts of data.
